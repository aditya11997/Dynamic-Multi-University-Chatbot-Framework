**Additional Information from the Web:** The given text describes the use of a new technology called ""Neural Voice Cloning"" by a company named Resemble AI. This technology can create a digital version of a person's voice by analyzing as little as 5 minutes of audio sample. The resulting synthetic voice can then be used to generate speech that sounds like the original person. The technology has various applications such as creating personalized voice assistants, voiceovers for animated characters, and even simulating the voice of a deceased person. However, the text also raises ethical concerns regarding consent, privacy, and potential misuse of this technology.**Sources:** ",en
